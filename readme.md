# Free Google Drive Shared Drive

This project contains a tool to automate free **Google Drive Shared Drive** by making API calls to a server side bot.

Normally, you'd be prompted a captcha for using such server side bots, however, with this tool, you're free to make as many API calls as required.


### Usage

Just clone / download the repository enter the following commands in the working directory:

```py
py -m __init__.py "example@gmail.com" "Shared Drive"
```

In the above command, you can replace the email and the drive name as you like.

<strong>"Individual users can only upload 750 GB each day between My Drive and all shared drives. Users who reach the 750-GB limit or upload a file larger than 750 GB cannot upload additional files that day. Uploads that are in progress will complete. The maximum individual file size that you can upload or synchronize is 5 TB."</strong>
