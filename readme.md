Google Drive Shared Drive
---

This project consists of a simple tool to generate a **Google Drive Shared Drive** using a simple API call with parameters for blocking any possible rate-limits.

*This program can be ran using cli.*

> Individual users can only upload 750 GB each day between My Drive and all shared drives. Users who reach the 750-GB limit or upload a file larger than 750 GB cannot upload additional files that day. Uploads that are in progress will complete. The maximum individual file size that you can upload or synchronize is 5 TB.

**Disclaimer**

This project, again, intended towards demonstrating the usefulness of API calls and having knowledge about internal API calls.

Any account termination / rate limit caused due to the excessive usage of this tool won't be held accounted for by the developer.
